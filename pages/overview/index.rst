Overview
===========
A decade ago, Bitcoin started as an alternative currency aiming to address the issues in central bank backed monetary systems. Today, Blockchain networks have reached a market capitalization of 2 trillion USD. These networks are being used to deploy alternatives of traditional financial instruments such as p2p payments, p2p lending etc. Governments and large financial institutions across the world are no longer ignoring these technological advancements, and the increased adoption of public blockchain networks.

Users of blockchain network interact with the network and other users via pseudo-anonymous identities. All these interactions are publicly visible. This public visibility allows anyone to analyze these user interactions without the dependence on companies to release datasets to the public.

Goals
===========
- Students will be able to understand the technical workings of public blockchain projects
- Students will get to work on projects that apply Data science tools to blockchain datasets
- Students will be able to create open and reproducible research on the analysis of blockchain data
