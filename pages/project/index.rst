Scope
======

Projects in this course are expected to be on quantitative analysis of blockchain data.
The analysis could be on the following (not exhaustive)

1. Data within a single blockchain project
2. Comparing different blockchain projects
3. Linking data within a blockchain to external data such as market data


Collaboration
=============

Successful projects in this course will require good project planning skills and efficient collaboration with other students in the group.
Students are highly encouraged to use collaboration tools from GitHub. Having a well maintained (clearly written issues, project boards etc) repository will help students present
progress during weekly presentations, get feedback and document progress.
